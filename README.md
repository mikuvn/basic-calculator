## description

this is a simple calculator coded in C that can perform the basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division as well as exponential powers. it runs via terminal/command-line entries and was created to practice coding basic applications and loop-based logic.

this calculator does not have input validation, invalid characters will terminate the program.

the calculator is relatively accurate (considering how floating-point computations are)... answers with long or trailing decimal values may be misrepresented.

## features

- supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponential operations.
- supports both integer and floating-point numbers.
- simple command-line interface for user interaction.

## usage

- download the source code OR clone this repository with:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mikuvn/basic-calculator.git
   ```
- compile the code using a C compiler (e.g., GCC). 
- run the executable via the terminal.
